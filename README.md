# Situational Awareness
Onboard and shoreside situational awareness software

This a consolidation of software I've developed since 2018 for providing asset 
situational awareness during research cruises.

It pulls together information that is delivered both ship based and shore based and makes it 
available on both onboard and shore side servers.
